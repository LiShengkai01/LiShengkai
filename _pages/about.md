I am a student majoring in Computer Science and Technology in the Institute of Computing Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(ICT, UCAS), from 2023. I focus on research work in the areas of runtime, GC algorithms, and applications on cloud data centers and mobile devices.

I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof.Xiaobing Feng](https://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496613.html) and [Prof.Chenxi Wang](https://wangchenxi7.github.io/home/) of Institute of Computing Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(ICT, UCAS).

Welcome to communicate with me via email!
